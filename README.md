# MediMinder

MediMinder is an application created for a final project for Data Structures 1 from Marquette University. The app was designed as a local run, reminder system to help patents who take larger amounts of medication on a regular basis.

## Getting Started

The project is a Windows Form Application and is run directly from Visual Studio.

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio Community 2013 or newer.

### Installing

Simply close the repo, load the Visual Sudio project, build a solution, and compile.

Using the tool bar at the top of the scree you can add medication or events. Medications can be linked to a event to display that the medication should be taken or should have been completed by that time.
